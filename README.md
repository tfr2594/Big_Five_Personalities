*This project provided a valuable learning opportunity in data cleaning and visualization. I utilized Jupyter Notebooks to initially explore and visualize a subset of the data, and then leveraged Excel to create dynamic charts that can be accessed by anyone familiar with the software. This experience encouraged me to delve deeper into the capabilities of Excel.

However, there were a few challenges that I encountered and would like to address in future projects. Firstly, I realized the importance of thoroughly understanding the data source. In this case, the Kaggle dataset indicated a 1 to 5 scale for disagree to agree, whereas the actual range was from very inaccurate to very accurate. This slight discrepancy taught me the significance of relying on accurate information when working with data.

Furthermore, during the data cleaning process, I overlooked the presence of 0 values in some of the questions. Later, I discovered that these values indicated skipped questions. Although it was surprising that such input was allowed, this experience emphasized the need for a thorough examination of the data to avoid overlooking important details.

Additionally, I could have implemented time requirements to exclude responses that were completed too quickly or took an excessive amount of time. This would have added an extra layer of refinement to the analysis.

Despite these challenges, I am satisfied with the visually appealing chart sheet I created. Approximately half of the charts were dynamic, and the final portion allowed for interaction by enabling users to change the displayed questions through a dropdown menu. I am now eager to embark on my next project, potentially focusing on analyzing corporate data.*
